#FactoryMod configuration file

#FactoryMod is a Spigot plugin, which allows players to setup predefined factories for an item cost. There are various
#factories with different purposes and pretty much everything about them is configurable. Their configuration is 
#handled within this file. Take great care to ensure that your configurations follow exactly the documentation provided
#here, otherwise unwanted effects/crashes and run time exceptions may occur.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Specifying items:

#Very often in this config you will have to specify items for a configuration. All item specifications are lists of 
#configurations, which contain information about the actual item, like this:

#inputmaterials:
#   inputmat1:
#       material: STONE
#   inputmat345FF:
#       material: DIRT

#Ensure that the identifer (here inputmat1 or inputmat345FF) all have the same intendation and never use duplicate
#identifers on the same level. Duplicate identifers which belong to a different configuration section are a bad habit,
#but should still work, while duplicate identifers on the same level will definitely not lead to the result you desire.
#This applies for every configuration option and not only for items. When you are required to specify a list of items
#you can also just put the option for it there, but not actually any identifers below it to list items and it will
#result in no cost/output.

#An example item config utilizing all possiblities could look like this:

#inputmat1:
#   material: STONE
#   durability: 3
#   amount: 456
#   name: SuperSpecialStone
#   lore:
#    - First lore line
#    - Even more lore
#   enchants:
#       enchantidentifier1:
#           enchant: SILK_TOUCH
#           level: 1
#       enchantgharbbl:
#           enchant: DAMAGE_ALL
#           level: 5


#material requires you to specify the type of the item. Use Spigot's official item identifers here, a full list of those
#can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

#durability allows you to specify the durability of the item. Note that this is not only limited to the durability of tools
#or armour, but instead the durability is also used to create different variations of the same material. For example orange
#wool is actually just white wool with a durability of 1. If this option is not specified it will default to 0, which is also
#minecraft's default durability for items. If you don't want to limit an item to a specific durability, but for example want to
#require any type of wool as an input, use -1 as durability. Make sure to only use this for inputs though, if you let a factory
#output an itemstack for players with a durability of -1, the item will be glitched. For a full list of all items and their 
#durabilities use this site: http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/

#amount allows you to specify the amount of the item, this isn't limited to 64 or whatever the maximum stack size of that
#item is, it can be any number (assuming it fits into an int). If not specfied this option will default to 1

#name allows you to define a custom name for this item, if this option is not set the item will have its vanilla name

#lore allows you to list lore which is added to the item. There is no limit to the lines of lore here, but after too many the
#minecraft client will stop display them properly. Defining lore is completly optional.

#Finally enchants allows you to list all the enchants wanted on this item, each enchant requires it's own config identifer.

#The two options requires per enchant are relatively straight forward, first of all you need to specify the enchantment type
#with it's spigot identifer. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html provides a
#full list of those. Second you will need to specify the level you want the desired enchantment to be, this may exceed the
#possibilites of vanilla without causing problems.


#You can also create items with specific meta data, currently supported are anything storing potion data, dyed leather armour
#and custom nbt tags

#For potion data (so for potions, splash potions, linering potions and tipped arrows) you can specify an additional section 
#like this:

#examplePot:
# material: POTION
# potion_effects:
#   type: LUCK
#   upgraded: true
#   extended: true
#   custom_effects:
#     exampleEffect1:
#       type: SPEED
#       duration: 1m
#       amplifier: 1

#Each potion always has one default effect and as many additional custom effects as desired

#type specifies the look of the potion and the base type of effect that will be applied by the potion. Not all possible status
#effects can be used here, but only the ones that have PotionData, as listed here: 
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html
#If not specified the type will default to AWKWARD

#upgraded specifies whether the default potion effect on the item is upgraded or not, per default this is false

#extended specifies whether the default potion effect on this item is extended or not, per default this is false

#custom_effects allows you to list other potion effects that are tied to this item, but don't affect it's item model, which is 
#determined by the primary potion effect

#To make dyed leather armour, two different formats are supported. The first one looks like this:

#exampleItem:
# material: LEATHER_HELMET
# color:
#   red: 255
#   blue: 0
#   green: 255

#The additional color section here has an option for each part of an RGB color, which is then applied on the item. All values
#must be within 0 and 255

#The other way to specify color of a leather item is directly through a hexadecimal number representing the RGB color like this:

#exampleItem2:
# material: LEATHER_BOOTS
# color: FF00FF

#Instead of using color as config identifier, you can as well just use it as option to directly specify the color in hex

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#General

#This section allows you to define global default values and some general stuff. 

#Additionally you can specify default options here, which are applied to all factories which use this option, unless
#you chose to overwrite the default for a specific factory, in that case the option specified in the factories config 
#will apply to it.

#The first option here is default_update_time. The update time describes how often a factory is ticked, ergo how often
#it checks whether it still has enough fuel, enough other resources to run and so on. This is basically the smallest
#time unit within your factory can possibly react and all other time values your factory works with should be multiples
#of this value. If they are not a multiple of this value, their de-facto value will be the next higher multiple of the
#update time, simply because whatever effect they have can only be applied if the factory is actually ticked. Note that
#this value highly influences the performance of this plugin, if FactoryMod is consuming more server power than you want
#it to, the first step should be to make this value higher. Recommended value is 1 second

default_update_time: 1s


#With the option default_fuel you can specify the default fuel for all factories which are consuming fuel in a furnace
#while running. This doesn't have to be a vanilla furnace fuel, but can be any item instead. A factory may chose to over
#write this option

default_fuel:
    charcoal:
        material: COAL
 

#default_fuel_consumption_intervall specifies a default for how often factories consume fuel. Basically every time a 
#factory which consumes fuel has run for the time specified here, one fuel unit will be consumed. This value should
#always be a multiple of the updatetime and a factory may chose to specify it's own value and not use the default value

default_fuel_consumption_intervall: 60s

#default_health specifies a default for how much health a factory has. Factories will continuously lose health over time and have
#to be repaired before they can be used again, once they are at 0 health
default_health: 10000

#default_menu_factory allows you to specify the menu for which factory will be opened when a player runs /fm without 
#specifying a factory. If this is not specified and the player runs "/fm" one will be picked randomly.
default_menu_factory: Workshop

#As a debug mode or to prevent additional information when tracking down bugs this plugin can log all of its inventory 
#interactions and the full inventories at that point, if desired. If this option is not specified it will default to true

log_inventories: true


#Additionally this plugin can disable vanilla nether portals. This isn't really part of the plugin's core functionality,
#but it was picked up from the first implementation of FactoryMod and stayed here after it's rewrite. Deal with it.
disable_nether: true


#When FCCs are in disrepair they will be removed after a set amount of time, which can be specified here
default_break_grace_period: 7d


#How often factories are passively decayed
decay_intervall: 1h

#How much health is decayed from factories by default each damaging run
default_decay_amount: 21

#Whether the yaml identifier or the factory name should be used when assigning recipes to factories, default to false
use_recipe_yamlidentifiers: true

#How often factory data is saved automatically. Recommended value and default is 15 minutes. Set to -1 to disable
saving_intervall: 15m
